                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>The first step in our redesign process was to conduct a heuristic analysis of the existing government website and annotate the primary site pages. These exercises helped us pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the site layout, navigation, design, and functionality. Using what our team knew about the DOI, we came up with two proto-personas to exemplify users who might visit this website and problems that they might encounter. </p>

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>This helped us decide what primary functions of the site we needed to include in our user testing. While developing proto-personas is a helpful exercise, our site redesign needed to be based upon real user feedback about the site. We interviewed six participants, and asked them to complete a series of tasks to test the usability of the website, as well as to give us their overall impression of the current design.</p>

              <p>The Department of the Interior’s website contains many resources and detailed information, but it is not organized in an intuitive, clear, user-oriented way. This inhibits users from fully engaging with the DOI, its resources, and initiatives. How might we create a more enjoyable experience for users and ultimately increase quarterly site visits and the average amount of time people spend on the site?

                        <p>Using our insights from user testing, we created a prioritization matrix to identify what features of the site were most important to the users.</p>
                        <p>User testing demonstrated that the site’s current organization of resources is not meeting the needs of the users; they had trouble locating specific information. With this pain point in mind, we conducted a card sorting activity to see how we might restructure the information architecture for our redesign.</p>
                        <p>In this phase, we also developed our style guide for use in our later prototypes.</p>
